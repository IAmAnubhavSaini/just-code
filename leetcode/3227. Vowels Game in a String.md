# 3227. Vowels Game in a String

If there are vowels in the input string, Alice can remove odd numbers of it: return true.
If there are no vowels or even vowels, Bob can remove even numbers of it: return false.

```go
func doesAliceWin(s string) bool {
	if strings.Contains(s, "a") || strings.Contains(s, "e") || strings.Contains(s, "i") || strings.Contains(s, "o") || strings.Contains(s, "u") {
		return true
	} else {
		return false
	}
}
```

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var doesAliceWin = function (s) {
    return ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"].some((v) => s.includes(v));
};
```

Think for a second; if there are any number of vowels >0, why would alice not take odd number of it out. When she does, only odd number of vowels will be left. So bob can't do anything to change the situation. Bob is a loser in this game. This is an only early bird gets the worm game.
