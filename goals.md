# Goals

1. Code, not the easy things.
2. Inventing stuff: things that were written in 70s.
3. Learn the things that I have ran away from: Leetcode, graphs.
4. Build up programmins skills by coding hard things: compiler (programming language), linter, editor...
5. Read some research that went into computer programming.

## But there is only goal or failure

The goal is to learn how-to-code by writing-code.

## How would I achieve it: How would I learn to code by coding

1. By writing code daily, hourly.
2. By reading others' code, reaserch papers
3. By NOT copying pasting stuff.
4. By building stuff in different PLs: C, go, rust
5. Pomodoro for 50 minutes + 10 minute break
6. By not getting stuck: by not staying there hitting my head, repeatedly, against a wall.
